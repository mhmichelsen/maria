				p When I was a kid, I fell in love with the power of storytelling. I was amazed at how it could change people's lives. How it changed mine. So much so that I got a master's degree in comparative literature and landed a sweet gig at the second largest publishing house in Denmark.
				p Working there, I made a big impact on the digital department by reducing turnaround times, which increased production from 500 to 10,000 ebooks a year while cutting production cost by 65%. I explored technological possibilities in digital books, brought ebooks to life with Javascript and animated GIFs, mingled with authors and editors, and advocated for accessibility in digital products. It was great, but something was missing for me. It took me a relocation of 5,455 miles to figure out what was lacking.
				p Moving to San Francisco, I suddenly found myself surrounded by designers and engineers, entrepreneurs and visionaries. They solved problems. Big problems, where the solutions had an immense impact on people's lives. <b>THAT</b> was what I was missing.
				p Stories are amazing and they can open our eyes to new horizons. But they can also be the comfort that takes us away from reality. There are problems out there that stand in the way of people's happiness. Some might seem small, but they have a big impact. Like the small habits that lead to poor financial health. The small decisions that harm our environment. The daily anxiety that stands in the way of a good night's sleep.
				p As a designer, I use storytelling every day in my problem-solving. I use it to align stakeholders to think of their users as real people. To craft thorough and coherent experiences that make people feel safe and understood. To balance the meticulous detail with the big narrative. And to find the overlooked and impactful problems that otherwise might go unnoticed.
				p For me, storytelling is user experience, interaction, visuals, delight, motion, brand, product feel, trustworthiness, and so much more. It's what helps me to design with both my mind and my gut to find solutions that are both functional and speaks to the senses. And most of all, storytelling for me is the ultimate way to empower people to live better lives.
