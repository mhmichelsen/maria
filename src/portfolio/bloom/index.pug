				h2 The Problem
				p
					| Most people are scared to invest. When they do, they often lose their money. Just ask the average investor, who earns 2.6% per year.

				p
					| Why? There’s a high learning curve to understanding how to value stocks as businesses.
				p
					| Investors today rely on charts, their peers, and the news to determine whether a stock is the right buy. Current financial apps overwhelm you with tons of financial metrics. Financial news apps stream minute by minute news updates, expecting you to know what to do.
				p
					| Successful investors know their companies and industries deeply. Even for them, it still requires arduous research to understand a company’s financials, strategy, and valuation.
			section.section
				h2 The Solution
				p
					| Facing this problem, we asked ourselves — how can we help the 86% who don’t invest today? How do we help more people invest in the best ideas? How do we help them take part in the wealth creation from innovation?
				p
					| Whatever we do, it has to build trust. It needs to protect you and do what’s in your best interest, not your brokers’. Next, it has to be simple. The stock market is a financial opportunity that should be available for everyone. Finally, it has to promote growth. We want to guide our users on the path to financial success.
				p
					| So we followed these principles and we built something brand new. Bloom helps you do three things:

				h2 The Design Process
				p
					| Design thinking was chosen because it is human-centered, solution-focused, flexible, iterative and fits well with an agile project management.
				.picture.w80
					img(src='/images/Bloom/DesignThinking.svg')
					figcaption The steps of the Design Thinking Process
				h3.bloom Empathize – Research & User Interviews
				p
					| For any product, the most important factor for a solid design foundation is to understand the users and their needs. To get a better understanding of which users would benefit the most from our product, we conducted research to establish our target audience.
				h4 Defining the Target Audience
				p
					| Research showed that Millennials by far was the group of people who were holding back on investing:
				.flex
					div
						blockquote
							p.quote “66% of Millennials say investing in the stock market is scary or intimidating.”
							p.source – Ally Financial survey
						blockquote
							p.quote
								| “42% of Millennials are investing conservatively, compared with 38% of Generation X investors and 23% of baby boomers.”
							p.source – Fidelity survey
					div
						blockquote
							p.quote
								| “Millennials hold 25% of their investments in cash, compared to 19% of investors overall.”
							p.source – Charles Schwab & Co
						blockquote
							p.quote
								| “Some Millennials may be putting their retirement security at risk by shying away from stocks now.”
							p.source – Forbes
				p
					| Therefore, in our search to define our core target audience, we decided to focus on Millennials. The next step was to interview this group to get a better understanding of their needs and restrictions.
				h4 User Interviews & Persona Development
				p
					| I conducted qualitative user interviews with the target audience to get a better understanding of their investments needs, goals, and experience. I made sure to include interviews with people outside the primary target audience, specifically people with higher investment experience.
				p
					| From the collected data I destilled the user interviews into 4 specific personas that represents our target audience:
				.flex.top.w80
					.picture
						img.w50(src='/images/Bloom/Persona1.svg')
						p
							b Nina the Newbie
							br
							| New to investing and seeking a way to learn more and to figure out how to start investing.
					.picture
						img.w50(src='/images/Bloom/Persona2.svg')
						p
							b Comfy Carl
							br
							| An intermediate investor, who feels insecure about investing and who fears investing based on emotions.
				.flex.top.w80
					.picture
						img.w50(src='/images/Bloom/Persona3.svg')
						p
							b Diligent Dana
							br
							| A more experienced investor, who is seeking a way to invest in better companies based on beliefs.
					.picture
						img.w50(src='/images/Bloom/Persona4.svg')
						p
							b Alex Advisor
							br
							| An professional investor looking for investment tools to recommend to less proficient investors.
				h4 Storyboarding & User Journeys
				p
					| I utilized user journeys and storyboarding for each of our defined personas to ensure that the key customer's needs were fully understood and taken into account in all design decisions.
				.picture.w50
					img(src='/images/Bloom/Carl_story.gif')
				h3.bloom.top Defining the Problem
				p
					| What are the issues that are holding Millinnials back from investing? In the next step in our process we dived more into this question to investigate and define what the issues were behind the problem.
				h4 Brainstorming & Issue Tree
				p
					| Based on the research and the conducted user interviews, we held a team brainstorming session where we used different techniques to uncover the core issues. I collected our findings in an issue tree, which would give us a solid foundation on which to base our solution ideation.
				.picture.w80
					img(src='/images/Bloom/Define.svg')
					figcaption Issue tree of the blockers that are holding Millennials back from investing
				h3.bloom Ideation
				p
					| Now that we had a better understanding of what the issues are that are holding Millennials back from investing, it was time to start exploring ideas for a product that could help alleviate as many of these issues as possible.
				h4 Brainstorming
				p
					| Using the issue tree we started exploring possible solutions. We let our minds run free to ensure that no idea was left unturned – even the idea of a comforting drone was on the table at some point.

					.picture
						img(src='/images/Bloom/Post-its-3.jpg')
				p
					| We sorted our solution ideas according to the isssues and looked into which ideas could be combined into a single product. Multiple ideas were explored until we found the core product, which we believed could bring solid improvement to our target audience.

					img(src='/images/Bloom/ideation.svg')
					figcaption Solution ideation leading to final product idea.
				h3.bloom Prototype - Test – Repeat
				p
					| Using the iterative process we moved on to the product development. I provided lo-fi and hi-fi wireframes as well as interactive prototypes that we continuous used to test our solutions on users to ensure that we were building the right product and that the user flow was as smooth as possible.
				.picture.w80
					img(src='/images/Bloom/ProductionFlow.svg')
					figcaption The iterative development flow
				p
					| For example, in the beginning our vision was to have a explore page which included both search and currated categories. Over time we found that having 2 functionalities on one screen created confusion and made the screen feel cluttered. In the final design, the two functionalities are, therefore, split into two seperate screens: • Discover • Search.

			section.section
				h2 Visual Design
				p
					| The visual design of the product was guided by two sets of core values, which would ensure consistency and that the core values were taken into consideration in all design decisions. The value sets are:
				h3 Bloom's Product Philosophy
				p The values that the product design must convay to the user:
				ul
					li
						b Trust
						|  – We do what's in your best interest, not your bankers'.
					li
						b Growth
						|  – We help you become the better investor.
					li
						b Simplicity
						|  – Accessible for any skill level.
				h3 Bloom's Brand Design Spine
				p The principles on which all design decisions are based:
				ul
					li
						b Vision
						|  – Development is driven by strong insight into the user base and the future.
					li
						b Principles
						|  – Things should be built by the principles that govern a user's lives
					li
						b Lovable
						|  – The product should delight and inspire. It's not something off the shelf.
				h3 Logo
				p
					| The logo mark is inspired by the core of Blooms name: the blooming of a flower. As a flower blooms its petals grow bigger and brighter in color. In the same manner, the three blooming spheres of Bloom grows bigger and brighter in color representing the user as he or she grows their investment skills.
				.picture.w80
					img(src='/images/Bloom/logo.svg')
				p
					| The three spheres' shapes are repeated in the three round spaces in the b and o's of the text mark. The overall shapes are kept organic to further underline the blooming feel of the brand, while square edges builds in a harmoneous contrast in the overall logo.
				h3 Color Palette and Typography
				p
					| The color palette was picked to make the product stand out compared to the competition by using a warm petrol blue as the primary color and contrasting it with lively orange. A range of black, white and gray tones are used to add a calm base to the palette. Red and green are cruzial for adding information cues to the user about positive and negative trends in a stock's information.

						img(src='/images/Bloom/Colors.svg', height='350')
					.picture
						img(src='/images/Bloom/Type.svg', height='350')
				p
					| Maven Pro and Roboto Condensed are used as the typographical pair in the design system. Maven Pro is chosen for it's warm and organic appearance, which matches well with Bloom's core values. It is used for heading. Roboto Condensed is chosen because it's more simple and strict appearance provides a good contrast to Maven Pro. It is, furthermore, very legible and suitable for displaying digits, which is an important factor in an investment app. It is used for paragraphs and all other textual elements.
				h3 Illustrations
				p
					| I chose to use illustrations for all visual elements. It makes the brand stand out compared to competitors who either avoids visuals or use stock photos.
